# Introduction
Hello and welcome to the Serverless book!

In this book we'll discover the [Serverless framework](http://serverless.com). It's a very powerful, yet easy to use developer tool to build modern, monstrously scalable (web) applications with the help of [FaaS](xx-glossary/01-glossary.md#faas) (Function as a Service) offerings from the cloud provider of your choice.

We'll use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our cloud provider throughout this book. However Serverless has multi provider support so you can built the applications we're building here on other cloud provider infrastructures as well (if your cloud provider has similar service / event offerings).

The first thing we'll look at is Amazon Web Services (AWS). We'll learn what AWS is and what services they offer which we'll use for our Serverless applications.

After that we'll learn more about the serverless architecture. What is the main purpose, why is it possible nowadays? And why is it a new, disruptive technology?

Next up we'll setup everything on our local machine so that we can use in combination with AWS.

An introduction to the [Serverless framework](http://serverless.com) follows next. What is the motivation of the Serverless framework, why was it developed and how does it work?

After that we'll start with our first Serverless [service](xx-glossary/01-glossary.md#service) to understand how the framework works. A deep dive into different application examples will give us more insight and learnings on how we can built modern, monstrously scalable, event driven applications.
