This is the source code of the Serverless `Todos` service.

You'll find two directories here.

1. The [backend](backend) directory contains the whole Serverless service and it's corresponding function code.
2. The [frontend](frontend) directory contains the different frontends you can connect to your backend to use the Todos service through your web browser.
